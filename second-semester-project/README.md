# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# AltSchool-Second-Semester-Exams

This is my submission for my AltSchool second semester exam. This project was built with ReactJs and compiled with Vite

It is a two paged website that shows the list of my repositories on the first page, and more details about each repository on the second page

It also uses Tailwind CSS for styling and reactrouter for routing.
